# Issues Found in Logs - Fixed

## Issues Identified from Your Logs

### 1. ‚ùå Missing Customer Email (First Request)
```
‚ùå VALIDATION ERROR: customer_email not found in request or metadata
```

**Cause**: Client sent incomplete payload without customer email
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Working as designed** - Proper validation caught the error
**Action**: No fix needed - client should include customer_email

---

### 2. ‚ùå Method Signature Error
```
Warning: Failed to update status for 1ayNTPjHu_lsW9jzqpMNOvBdoPCx57kio:
GoogleDriveService.update_file_status() got an unexpected keyword argument 'payment_intent_id'
```

**Cause**: **Duplicate method definitions** in `google_drive_service.py`
- Line 885: ‚úÖ Had `payment_intent_id` parameter
- Line 968: ‚ùå Did NOT have `payment_intent_id` parameter (DUPLICATE)

The duplicate was overriding the correct one.

**Fix**: ‚úÖ **Removed duplicate methods** (lines 920-1007)
- Removed duplicate `find_files_by_customer_email` (lines 920-966)
- Removed duplicate `update_file_status` (lines 968-1007)

**Result**: Now only ONE method with correct signature:
```python
async def update_file_status(self, file_id: str, new_status: str, payment_intent_id: str = None)
```

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Old Logging Format in Logs

**Issue**: Your logs show the OLD logging format:
```
üí≥ PAYMENT SUCCESS WEBHOOK
   Customer: vdanishevsky@nupsys.com
```

**Expected NEW format should show**:
```
================================================================================
üí≥ PAYMENT SUCCESS WEBHOOK - INCOMING REQUEST
================================================================================
üì• INCOMING PAYLOAD:
{...full JSON...}
```

**Cause**: Server hasn't reloaded with new changes
**Fix**: ‚úÖ New comprehensive logging already implemented
**Action**: Restart server to see new logging

---

## Summary of Fixes

### ‚úÖ Fixed
1. **Removed duplicate `update_file_status` method** - now accepts `payment_intent_id` correctly
2. **Removed duplicate `find_files_by_customer_email` method**
3. **Added comprehensive incoming/outgoing logging** (needs server restart)

### ‚úÖ Working as Designed
1. **Customer email validation** - Correctly rejects requests without email
2. **Files moved successfully** - Second request worked correctly (had email)

---

## Your Question: "How file has been moved if customer email missing?"

**Answer**: The file was NOT moved when email was missing!

Looking at your logs:
1. **First request**: ‚ùå Validation failed ‚Üí NO files moved
   ```
   ‚ùå VALIDATION ERROR: customer_email not found in request or metadata
   ```

2. **Second request**: ‚úÖ Had customer email ‚Üí Files moved successfully
   ```
   Customer: vdanishevsky@nupsys.com
   ‚úÖ SUCCESS: 1/1 files moved to Inbox
   ```

The system is working correctly - it REQUIRES customer email before moving files.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the server** to activate:
   - New comprehensive logging
   - Fixed `update_file_status` method

2. **Test with actual client payload** to see new logging format

3. **Client should always send** `customer_email` in:
   - Root level: `"customer_email": "user@example.com"` OR
   - Metadata: `"metadata": {"customer_email": "user@example.com"}`
