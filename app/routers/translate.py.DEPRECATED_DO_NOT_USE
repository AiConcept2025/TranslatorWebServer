⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE THIS FILE ⚠️

This router is DEPRECATED and should NOT be used or imported.

REASON FOR DEPRECATION:
- Contains STUB page counting (hardcoded 1 page per file)
- Does not handle file content (no base64 decoding)
- Does not perform subscription validation correctly
- Frontend does NOT call this endpoint

CORRECT ENDPOINT:
The production endpoint is in app/main.py:
- Route: POST /translate (NOT /api/translate)
- Has accurate page counting via page_counter_service
- Handles file content properly
- Performs accurate subscription validation

This file was renamed from translate.py to prevent accidental use.

DATE DEPRECATED: 2025-01-18
DEPRECATED BY: Claude Code debugging session
ISSUE: Subscription validation using stub page counts (1 page/file)
"""

# OLD STUB IMPLEMENTATION REMOVED
# See app/main.py POST /translate for correct implementation
